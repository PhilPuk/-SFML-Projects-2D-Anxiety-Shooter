Currently learned from this projects:

1. Write code way more abstract.
    Example: There is a shop system where you render money text, but there is also a text ingame where you render money text.
    Instead of having two different texts, just use one and implement it in both systems.
    Easier to synchronize and to update + less complexity.
  

2. Write own class for big stuff.
     Having a shop system where money is used and money for ingame but both is the same.
     Write an class for the money, instead making money for each class itself.

3. ALWAYS FOLLOW THE BASIC PRINCIPLES!
    Will keep the code cleaner, more readable, and makes it easier to refactor it.
    Use a clean method of writing comments and stay loyal to the way you do it, if you want to change it, changed it everywhere.

4. Simplify the problems.

5. Use the advances techniques only if needed!
